## Implementation Notes

Each issue should be:
- **Properly sized**: Can be completed by one person in 1-2 weeks
- **Well-defined**: Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Documented**: Include implementation notes and references
- **Tested**: Include testing strategy and validation criteria
- **Integrated**: Work with existing infrastructure and follow patterns

Priority should be given to monitoring and logging (Issues 1-2) as they provide immediate operational value.
